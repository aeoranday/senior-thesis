\subsection{XENON1T Detector}
The XENON1T detector is a dual phase xenon time projection chamber (TPC) located in the \textit{Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso} (LNGS) in central Italy.
The detector aimed to observe weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) as the primary candidate for dark matter particles.
It was a requirement for the detector to be sensitive to keV energy levels in order to observe these particles and was made possible through a combination of the stable xenon 136 isotope, water shielding, and depth within the Gran Sasso massif.
